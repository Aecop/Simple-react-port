# React Portfolio

This is my professional React Portfolio for future recruiters.

## Description

This portfolio will guide users who is seeking potential employer to help them understand my skillset, education and experience.

## Usage

This has not publicly deployed yet due to still work in progress. As for UW bootcamp module turn in, I will publish this on github. 

## Future Plan

For the future plan, I am wanting to fix the email submission part and also make it responsive. So that people who are viewing through mobile
devices are able to easily guide and locate section in my portfolio
